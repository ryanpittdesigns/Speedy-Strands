    <h2>How to Design Simple Rings</h2>

    <p>These are some very basic rings that are seen often and sold in many accessory stores. I had purchased one about a year ago and lost it. Instead of going out and buying another one I decided to figure it out myself and make one. I mean its only wire, how hard could it be? By following these step by step instructions the answer to that question is its pretty easy.  </p>
  
    <h1>Materials</h1>
          <p>Plyers<br>Wire Cutters<br>Accent Piece (Small Charm)<br>A Mold<br>Super Gule (If you Feel Nessassary)</p>
    <h1>Step By Step For a Simple Ring</h1>
    <p>1. Cut off an apporiate amount of wire. I usually cut a good amount becuase I know I am going to end up cutting it anyways. </p>

    <p>2.  Take the mould and wrap the wire around it in the spot you would like to designate is similar in size to your finger. What I do is just fold it aorund my finger because my wire is not as thick.</p>

    <p>3. Now take the back side of the ring, this is where the excess wire is located and cut it down leaving just a small bit to wrap in a circle. </p>

    <p>4.  Once cut then wrap the little bit left into small circles. This is where you can superglue if you feel is nessessary.</p>

    <p>5. I like to put the ring in circles this way it is adjustable, somedays I feel as though I can be bloated. That might be just me though. </p>

  <h1>Tips</h1>
  <p> Wire! Wire is a hard material to work with. It can be very sharp and at times can be tough to use if you buy one too thick. I was at the craft store sitting on the floor trying to figure out what size I prefered. I ended up going with a very small wire in thickness. </p>
